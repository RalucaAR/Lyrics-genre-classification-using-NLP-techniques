    "The first approach used in order to classify the lyrics by genre is to use the classical Bag of words (BOW) technique togheter with the Support Vector Machine model. BOW is a natural language processing technique used to represent a colection of documents by the word present in it. All the words present in all the documents of the colection represents the vocabulary of known words; every document is represented as a list of numbers with the dimension equals with the number of the words from the vocabulary. So every number from the list represents the number of occurances of the i-th word (from the vocabulary) in the current document.\n",

The next step is to pass this preprocessed input to the BOW model.The obtained output will be passed to the SVM model. Our purpoise is to see if the results obtained using BOW can be overtaken by other methods."

The hiper parameters were tuned after some trying, but not with the best possible values as the accuracy of the models was not the scope of this project. It was observed that the SVM model performs better than the others for the given dataset.\n",
