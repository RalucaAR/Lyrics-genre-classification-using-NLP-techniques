# Lyrics-genre-classification-using-NLP-techniques

The goal of this project is to classify the lyrics provided in the test dataset using various NLP techniques. The first approach used in order to classify the lyrics by genre is the usage of the classical Bag of words (BOW) technique togheter with the Support Vector Machine model (SVM) as a baseline.

As NLP methods, in this project we used term frequency–inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) and word embeddings. In order to improve our results, we applied various modifications over the data as the removing of the non-english lyrics, the removal of the stopwords, applying the steamming process and adding a new feature for our data: the number of words per line. Because we wanted to offer a strong comparisson of the final results, we compared the results obtanined by applying the above-mentioned method with the cases in which we do not appled them.
